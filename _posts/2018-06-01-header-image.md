I don’t want to go to the protest today.
And I don’t like being attacked for it.
Have I not been to enough of them already? I walked for miles, and I held one of those posters someone handed to me. Bhagat Singh or someone, I forget. And has it not been like a month since we started doing this? I can't even see an end in the near future. 
Protests are a weird affair. There’s dancing, there’s singing, people shouting till their voices break. A few hours of that always tires me out, and I prefer to go to a nice place to eat afterward. Or go to oxford and browse books on politics and history or read a newspaper. I like to keep up with current affairs.
The last time I went to a protest, I saw a bunch of guys in the white caps that Muslims wear, visibly poor, walking by my side. They had to be there, to protest, right? Me on the other hand, my identities shielded me from the heat and the violence; the dead bodies whose names appear in the papers every day didn't have a name like mine. That protection was my inheritance. My presence, therefore, in these rallies, was purely as an ally, against an enemy I simply chose to make my own, all for an imaginary certificate I can wave proudly on my Facebook profile. There, I helped. As you can see from my Hindu name, I didn't need to be there. But I was. And now I am officially an anti-fascist. Vive la résistance!

But the whole act of being aware all the time is tiring. So I stopped opening the WhatsApp chats of event invites, and stop replying to people who only talk of politics. It’s draining. I want to disappear conveniently when my presence is demanded and you would only see flashes of my existence through Instagram stories at Hoppipola. Grow up, everyone needs alcohol. 

But I am not ignorant. I can fluently quote Orwell or Lenin, depending on how centrist my immediate surrounding was. I am well versed on Zizek and Chomsky, and to not appear too out of touch, some Arundhati Roy and Khushwant Singh too. The effort I have put in, in conversing with my housemaid and driver other than the usual yes and no, will come up in every conversation you have with me. This is my "groundwork".
And If my grandchildren ask me where I was when the detention camps were being built, I have a couple of pictures to show them of me, with posters I didn't make. With Instagram filters, of course, I'm not a savage. 
At times, however, my social anxiety gets the best of me. And why risk panic attacks? I’ll probably be out of this country in two years or so and none of this would matter. I'm hoping Bernie would be my president. Maybe I'll join his campaign. 
But stop before you accuse me of anything. I made that post about UP children being raped, and I regularly post a link on Shaheen Bagh and Jamia, I keep my otherwise imbecile friends and acquaintances updated on other people's sacrifices. See those women braving the cold? That's the feminist movement right there. I'm glad I got the front row seats. 
And my writeups on hopelessness generated 200 shares on Facebook. Doesn't that qualify as "action"? I have a few Bhakts on my contact list too, I think I'm 2 links away from generating empathy in them. This is work and I don't care what you have to say.
Someone on my friendlist made a post about how mental health should be our primary concern. "I have suffered from mental instability all my life. Frankly, it's insensitive and ableist of you to attack me like this, and expect me to show up at every protest", he wrote. Or something of the kind. Fair enough. Maybe the women who were brutalized by the police station are all undergoing state-mandated therapy. I can imagine them with slices of cucumbers on their eyes, a margarita in their hands, and their heads thrown back on the sofa, taking a "mental health" day. And what if not? I can afford to have anxiety, I can afford to take care of myself. So yes, it ableist of you to expect me to show up at a rally when I have a cocktail of mental illnesses, especially when all this hatred and violence doesn’t really affect me. I don’t say the last part out loud. People tend to be very judgemental.
