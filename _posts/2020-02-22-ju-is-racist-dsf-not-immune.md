This is not the first time a fairly open call has been made to non-Bengali students to “go back to their states”, echoing a very common slogan from alt-right rallies. However disappointing it is, it’s not surprising, and definitely not new. As the election campaigns were taking place across the campus in the past week, I felt the presence of this inherent unspoken assumption(outside the campaigns of course), if non-Bengali, assume ABVP. If this assumption presents some validity to you, let me break down its naked implications. If (doesn’t speak my language), assume (sexist, racist, Hindutva-lover, hate monger).

Some professors (not in my class, but then again I have attended too few) who have been long residents of this university, have expressed their grave concerns repeatedly over “Bihari”s destroying the campus. It’s a strong accusation, which almost always goes uncontested, unprotested. In strictly Bangali groups, you can always hear anti-Bihari jokes, the strong hatred for “those people” is palpable.
In the light of the recent NRC and CAA, when we are fighting for the respect and rights of immigrants, the inherent hatred for the immigrants among us speaking a different language is paradoxical, surprising, and reveals something very fundamental to human nature- we all want to feel better than someone else, however false and superficial that superiority may be.

There’s an interesting story I found in the account of a Holocaust survivor I read a few months ago which I find relevant now more than ever. In 1942, when people of various ethnicities (other than Germans of course) were being rounded up in the camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, an unfortunate Jewish gentleman was given the task of imprinting a different number on the wrist of every man and woman who had entered the compound, and as the number of “prisoners” of the camp went higher, so did the numbers carved on their wrist. Soon the tattooist discovers, due to the presence of limited resources, fights had broken out between the Polish and Romani prisoners, with the Polish claiming that the smaller number on their wrist (implying they came here earlier) granted them a bigger share of the resources. As tragic as the entire context may be, the story is not new and neither is the sentiment.

But why Biharis? We have grouped students from Jharkhand, UP, and any north Indian state with an accent different from ours as “Bihari” but why? Did we fall into the same trap set up by the mass media and Bollywood of narrowing down native dialects and culture, Maithili and Bundelkhandi, with ghutka, imperfect Hindi and Lalu Prasad Yadav?

It’s time we ask the right questions, however uncomfortable it may be, it’s time we self reflect. The domicile issue that reignited this racial divide a year ago, saw many GB’s and discussions, but there was an evident lack of convergence of ideas, and the issue of a 90% domicile for state residents remained practically unprotested. I’m sure the conflicting ideas of caste and class issues dominated the general body meetings, but behind the polished Bangla sentences and half-baked directionless posts, the underlying sentiments were exposed in personal sittings, “bhalo hoyeche, newa jaye na eder.” This obviously doesn’t span to every single bangali student, but the sentiments of the few if unprotested becomes the responsibility of everyone, which is why I’m writing this. Out of guilt.

The domicile issue, let us all admit, was not as unidirectional as it seemed on the surface, and its dimensions I feel remain to be explored and understood. However, in my four years in Jadavpur, the only thing that I pride myself upon learning, is the ability to protest uncompromisingly, and the fact that the state and authority will always uphold the status quo, they’ll diminish your existence, and attempt to undermine your power; any decision that the authority (and not by a long stretch, the state) takes for the “betterment” of students, demands the largest stakeholder of the university, us, to have a say in it. Even though we hadn’t converged on the issue of the validity of domicile, **was it not in our ethical duty to protest a decision that was forced on us by the same state?** Did we on that particular occasion suspect that the authority did have our betterment in mind? Or did we mask our internalized hatred for the “biharis” with diplomatic words, thanked our stars that the issue died down in our circles, and moved on? The questions are uncomfortable, the answers even more so, but it’s high time we face them head-on.

I can go on elaborating this problem statement, but I suspect I have successfully established the premise of the issue. The obvious question that follows is what is the solution? Before we get to that part, we have to ask ourselves one more uncomfortable question. Are we giving this problem statement the respect it deserves? Even with my objective view (the privilege of being personally detached from the issue), I believe otherwise- we’re not acknowledging the problem nor respecting its depth and importance, and if we fail to harness self-awareness of our indifference, we will be losing an ideological war, at the cost of comfortable bigotry and indifference.

Why is DSF relevant here? Well, it’s not. I never believed that DSF was the “flag-bearer” of our union, nor will it ever be, I don’t believe it has the power or grasp to eliminate deep-rooted issues like sexism and racism from our campus, or build a thicker wall around it. However, inaction is action, silence is a political stance, and diplomacy and apologies are skin deep. If we attack an ABVP supporter on his pronunciation of “student” or ABVP women on her gender, we might appear to win the comment section war, but the loss is far too big, and irreversible.

We have to understand that issues like sexism and racism, though rooted in the same fundamentalist bigotry and insecurities, occupy very different spheres, they intersect freely and never cancel each other out. Do we believe no Dalit man beats his wife? Or no woman in burqa crosses the street on seeing a trans person coming their way? Does that eliminate the oppression they face? Or are the identities of oppressed and oppressor fluid in nature, and not neat little boxes we can sort away people into?

JU has been a haven for my thoughts and expressions, but the one thing that saddens me the most is the inability of my peers to handle nuance, and this quality permeates very well to the activist section. You’re either a predator or a victim, abuser or abused, communist or fascist, a DSF sympathizer or an outright bigot. Other than the rigidity and inaccuracies of these assumptions, these divisions and lines allow very little space for the emotional and political growth of the individual, and of course, hinder everyone’s ability to handle nuances and harness conflicting ideas and accept validity wherever due. Needless to say, I’ve encountered bigots inside and outside DSF, and I’ve been unable to find any consistencies of the languages they spoke or the names they had.

So now, in the words of a bald man I adore, What Is To Be Done? I doubt if any single individual on the campus has the faculty to answer all of it at once. I am all too far from it. However, some small important steps can land us closer to finding the solution, instead of dismissing the problem.
We pride ourselves as our policymakers on the campus, but do we take into account the lack of non-Bengali speakers in these GBs? Are we making policy-making inaccessible to some based on language? Of course, efforts have been taken to bridge the gap, I’ll admit, but the numbers are still small, their absence is still significant.

The state houses several dialects of Bangla, and the country is home to quite a few more languages with their own set of dialects, so that, of course, finds it’s representation in JU. Why then, are every major policy discussion or outlook expressed on Facebook in 500 words Bangla essays with words that are beyond even my vocabulary? (I survived Sahityer Itihash in school, for context) Who are these essays meant for? Are the three of you savarna intellectual leftists going to circle jerk each other into a communist utopia? Pardon me for my profanities, my vocabulary, as you rightly suspect, is weaker than yours.

The vapid intellectualism and elitism have to end, the rigorous attempts to label people and categorize them has to end. The hypocrisy of opposing NRC and at the same time having a strong unbased prejudice against kids who left the comfort of their home for better education, has to change. Or elections like these, will leave the non-Bengali kids with only two options- to hate, or to be hated? Before preaching our inclusivity it is of utmost importance we acknowledge the problems the struggles of these kids, let go of our inherent fundamentalism and accept all as our own. Until we do that, our fight at large will remain incomplete and ideologically hollow, and to an extent, opportunistic. The idea is to lose our chains, not pass it on to someone else.
